# **Galactic Kittens**

Galactic Kittens is a 2D co-op space adventure sample game where players must blast off to space and defeat all of the possible enemies in a small time range. This project was made using **Netcode for Game Objects**, our networking library. 

This game sample is all designed to help you learn how to apply and synchronize sprite animations, particle effects, basic 2D movement of GameObjects, synchronize UI status, and more.
